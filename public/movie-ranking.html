<h3>Thor (2011)</h3>
<p>Director Kenneth Branagh drew on his background to lend a Shakespearean gravitas to this first solo entry regarding one of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes: Thor, son of Odin, wielder of the hammer Mjölnir, and everyone’s favorite God of Thunder. Exiled from the mythical realm of Asgard by his father to our own planet, the blonde deity — seriously, was Australian actor Chris Hemsworth created in a laboratory for the sole purpose of playing this comic-book character?! — he quickly catches the eye of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and begins to settle into his new home. His trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has other plans, however. It’s a great introduction to the character and the Kirby-esque world his divine peers call home, not to mention Hiddleston’s sly take on a supervillain that would soon become a key MCU staple. </p>
<h3>V for Vendetta (2005)</h3>
<p>“Remember, remember, the fifth of November….” Alan Moore’s dystopian tale of a masked vigilante — that Guy Fawkes visage would soon become the default visual symbol for 21st century political-underground activists — is a radical re-imagining of superhero mythology, in which a costumed crusader becomes the fly in the fascist alt-future ointment. And this adaptation from director James McTeigue and producers/writers Lily and Lana Wachowski comes impressively close to capturing the comic legend’s voice, leaning heavily into the notion that there’s a fine line between terrorists and freedom fighters even when super powers (via mutations from a government-sponsored virus) are involved. Long before she’d aid the God of Thunder — or pick up the hammer herself — a shaven-headed Natalie Portman would aid and abet the man known as “V,” as he mobilizes an army against totalitarian forces. Let’s just say it’s the rare superhero movie that seems to get more prescient as the years go by.</p>
<h3>Wonder Woman (2017)</h3>
<p>Gal Gadot radiated benevolence as the title character — an Amazon warrior who earns the “wonder” part of her name — in a way that no actor had managed in a superhero movie since Christopher Reeve. And the World War I setting of Patty Jenkins’ film helped familiar tropes feel fresh, as did the simple fact that a female superhero was finally getting a great movie of her own. The No Man’s Land battle scene, with Wonder Woman’s costume practically glowing against the gray backdrop as she deflects bullets and pummels soldiers, is indelible.</p>
